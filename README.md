This app is meant to be used as a discgolf stats app, where you can upload scores on the go and check out previous scores and statistics. 

The app does not at the moment have internet databases or user functions, as it was meant for personal use, but it does have local database.

You can upload round scores, add new players, check out previous scores, get information about (installed) courses and their hole layouts and look into player stats.
